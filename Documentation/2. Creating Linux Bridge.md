# 2. Creating Linux Bridge

## Steps

1. Go to `Datacenter > Proxmox > System > Network > Create > Linux Bridge > Create`
    - Why not enter anything else?
        - We are telling Proxmox to use `vmbr0` for connection between it and the router.
        - VMs and LXCs will be configured in their own settings to set the Firewall as their gateway.
        - This setting is for Proxmoxâ€™s connections and managing bridges.
